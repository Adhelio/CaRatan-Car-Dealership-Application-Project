# CaRatan-Car-Dealership-Application-Project
This project was performed by a team of 6 students as a condition for graduating a course from the 3rd Semester, Mobile Application Development. I was the full stack & programming lead of team, including the front-end and back-end development. I also designed the User Experience and User Interface of the application. This application is about a used car dealership that helps promote car sellers.
